# DuperPutty
This is a bash shell script that can give a multiplexing experience similar to that of the Windows tool "SuperPutty"

- This requires TMUX and Byobu be installed.
- The reason for byobu is its simplified key bindings and general nicer ease of use (in my opinion).

Example:

./DupperPutty.sh <session_name> <username> 'HOST1 HOST2 HOST3'
